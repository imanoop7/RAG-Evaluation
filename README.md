# RAG Evaluation Using Ragas

Welcome to the "RAG Evaluation Using Ragas" repository! In this project, we delve into the evaluation of Region Adjacency Graphs (RAGs) by leveraging the power of ragas (musical compositions) as an analogy.

## Overview

Region Adjacency Graphs play a crucial role in image segmentation and understanding spatial relationships between regions. Inspired by the intricate connections in ragas, we explore how RAGs can be evaluated and fine-tuned for better performance.

## Features

- **Raga-Based Metrics**: We propose novel metrics inspired by ragas to assess the quality of RAGs.
- **Evaluation Notebook**: The `rag_evaluation_using_ragas.ipynb` notebook contains code and explanations for evaluating RAGs.
- **Visualizations**: We visualize RAGs and their properties using musical notation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/RAG-Evaluation.git
   cd RAG-Evaluation

2. Install the necessary dependencies (see requirements.txt).

3. Explore the rag_evaluation_using_ragas.ipynb notebook to understand the evaluation process.

## Usage
The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on evaluating RAGs using our proposed metrics. Dive into the world of RAGs and discover their harmonious qualities!
